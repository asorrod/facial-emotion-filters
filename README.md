# Real-Time Emotion Filters

This project detects facial emotions in real-time and applies fun visual filters (fire, rain, confetti, cartoon-like effects) depending on the detected emotion.  
It uses **Python, OpenCV, dlib, FER (Facial Emotion Recognition), and Streamlit**.

- Dynamic filters overlayed on the face:
  - 🔥 Fire for "angry"
  - 🌧️ Rain for "sad"
